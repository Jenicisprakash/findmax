Coding Challenge
ï‚² Consider you are having an array of strings ["a","b","c","a","b","c","a","e"] in
which the strings will have duplicate values. You have to find each string's duplicate count. 
1. If the count of a particular string is odd, then print that string and its count
2. If the count of a string is even, dont print
Note : The string can be anything and the array length can





const myArray = ["a","b","c","a","b","c","a","e"];

let uniqueElements = [...new Set(myArray)];

const elementCounts = uniqueElements.map(value => [value, myArray.filter(str => str === value).length]);

console.log(elementCounts);

if (elementCounts % 2 != 0){
    console.log("The Odd Values is :",elementCounts[0],elementCounts[3])
}
else{
    console.log("")
}
